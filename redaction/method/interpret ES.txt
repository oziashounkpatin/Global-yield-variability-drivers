In sum, effect size distributions in ecology are leptokurtic. 
They have a sharp peak at zero, but very heavy tails.** Which means 
that the typical effect size of published ecological studies is moderate 
to large in absolute magnitude, for one standard definition of “moderate to large”.

We used the conventional interpretation of the magnitude 
of the effect size provided by Cohen (1969), where 0 
indicates no effect, 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 is medium, 0.8 is 
large and 1.0 indicates a very large effect. We examined a 
funnel plot of effect size estimates and sample sizes; the 
symmetry observed in this plot did not suggest evidence of 
publication bias (Begg 1994).

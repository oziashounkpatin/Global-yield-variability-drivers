## 📘 Overview
The study synthesizes global data to identify key drivers of yield variability in regenerative farming systems, focusing on the roles of climate, soil, and topography.

## 🧮 Contents
- `data/` – cleaned datasets and metadata  
- `scripts/` – R scripts for data processing and meta-analysis  
- `figures/` – figures and plots generated by the analysis  
- `outputs/` – summary tables and model outputs  

## ⚙️ Reproducibility
All analyses are implemented in **R**, with dependencies listed in `renv.lock`.  
To reproduce the environment:
```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
